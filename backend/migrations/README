# Alembic Database Migrations

Hi, the initial migration has been created. You can run the following commands to apply the migration:

```bash
alembic upgrade head
```

And if you want to create a new migration, you can run the following command:

```bash
alembic revision --autogenerate -m "message"

# This will create a new migration file in the migrations/versions directory.

# After you have made the necessary changes to the migration file, you can run the following command:

alembic upgrade head
```

And if you want to downgrade the database, you can run the following command:

```bash
alembic downgrade -1
```
